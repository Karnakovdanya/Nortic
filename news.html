            <h4>Dev news, key milestones, and launch plans.</h4>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Dragon’s Vow</h2>
        <p>Dragon’s Vow is a story‑driven action adventure about the bond between a heroine and an ancient dragon; this hub aggregates the entire road‑to‑release: current build status, key milestones, and sprint‑based launch plans. Expect teaser drops, playtest reports, notes on duo mechanics (synchronized finishers, shared ultimate, combat readability), plus performance and visual updates. Dedicated posts outline the roadmap: preview beats, release‑branch prep, platform windows, and post‑launch patches. Tags and filters are included—builds, combat, narrative, music, optimization, dates—so visitors can find updates fast. Subscribe to updates to get new builds, release dates, and behind‑the‑scenes content first.</p>

            <h2>Dragon’s Vow: Playtests & Metrics</h2>
            <h4>Completed playtest: dodge readability improved; metrics show fewer camera timing drops.</h4>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Dragon’s Vow</h2>
        <p>Ran focused sessions with scripted combat scenarios and camera telemetry. Dodge windows are clearer via refined visual and audio cues, and auto‑framing loses target less often during dashes. Player reaction time improved, while miss rates on dodge windows decreased. Next sprint will target edge cases: tight corridors, multi‑target encounters, and rapid elevation changes.</p>

            <h2>“Twilight Blade” Mode</h2>
            <h4>1v1 duels with a Blood Moon timer</h4>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Blood Moon</h2>
        <p>A competitive 1v1 mode with short, high‑tempo rounds governed by a “Blood Moon” timer that ramps up intensity in the final seconds. Ranked progression includes seasonal resets, rating points, and a duel‑only balance pass for weapons and stances to prevent PvE snowballing. A pre‑match build screen lets players fine‑tune stances, talents, and consumables, with presets for newcomers and advanced players. Parry/riposte windows are signposted for better readability, while the camera adds gentle auto‑reframing in close quarters. Matchmaking weighs MMR and latency, and every duel can be saved as a replay with shareable clips. Victories earn cosmetics—finisher effects, mask and sheath skins, plus profile banners for win‑streak milestones.</p>

            <h4>Stealth action in a gothic city: new routes and challenges</h4>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Shadow Bound</h2>
        <p>The update adds alternative infiltration paths across the bridge and cathedral district: icy balcony ledges, underground links, and rooftop tightropes. Light/shadow rules are stricter—lamps and lunar “spotlights” reshape guard cones; snow muffles footsteps but exposes tracks. New “Night Oath” contracts rank completion by time and stealth, with fresh tools—grapple line and smoke seal—and relics that boost parkour and silent takedowns. Distant city vistas and auto‑framing on narrow passages are optimized; loads are faster and checkpoints more frequent in high‑difficulty segments.</p>

        </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Ghost Wire</h2>
        <p>Introduces “Silent Fracture” missions focused on stealth with brief firefights. New tactical gadgets: a pulse suppressor (mutes shots for 5s), a motion scanner (shows guard cones on the minimap), and an echo decoy to divert patrols. Recoil on pistols re‑tuned, with new mods—suppressed barrel and quick‑slide. AI now investigates sound sources by priority tiers. Maps gain alternate entries, rope anchor points, and foliage cover. Settings include a recoil‑intensity slider and sensitivity presets for gamepad/mouse. Time‑trial challenges and a leaderboard support speed‑clear runs.</p>
